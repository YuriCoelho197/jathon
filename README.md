# ThisIsJathonTheSadnessAndBrokenHeartMan.py

# Requires

- PYTHON 3.6
- LACK OF OWN LOVE
- LACK OF SERVICE

# Why?

- Every time I saw Java on the Fine Gold Road
from afar I saw the figure of a boy
who ran to open the gate and then came asking me:
"Touch your young fellow to listen to me."
[Every Time I saw Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R6LQms4UZo)

- It's no use
Enough of suffering, enough to cry
You abused too much.
We can no longer continue
Where I walked, you walked
Where I swore, you swore
Where I cried, you cried
My proposal you accepted.
[Go to hell with you love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TeE3HoPYeo)

- You broke my heart, oh
But my love, no problem, no, no.
Now what's left over (what, what, oh)
One piece for each scheme
Only one piece
[You crash my heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp-dKdSUuLk)
